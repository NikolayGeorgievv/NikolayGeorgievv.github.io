                <summary class="aboutSumm">Can you tell me about yourself?</summary>
                <p class="aboutPara">I graduated Softuni's Java development with excellent score.
                    I am continuing my education in the field of Software development as I look forward to learn new
                    technologies,
                    programming languages and frameworks.</p>

                <summary class="aboutSumm">What are your strengths?</summary>
                <p class="aboutPara">I am a passionate person and I always put my heart into everything I do.
                    I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn new things.</p>
            </details>

                <summary class="aboutSumm">What are your weaknesses?</summary>
                <p class="aboutPara">I am a perfectionist and I always strive for perfection.
                    Sometimes that involves spending too much time on a task to make sure it is perfect.</p>

            <details class="details-transition">
                <summary class="aboutSumm">What technologies and frameworks you can use and feel comfortable with?</summary>
                <p class="aboutPara">I'd say my Java skills are quite strong. My favorite framework to go with Java is Spring/Spring Boot.
                    I'm familiar with MYSQL and relational databases, Mockito for testing and JS/HTML/CSS for Front-End. Python and MLM are my
                    new thing now, and I am advancing at great pace!</p>

            <details class="details-transition">
                <summary class="aboutSumm">Has software development changed you in any way?</summary>
                <p class="aboutPara">Yes, it is helping me to convert my weaknesses into strengths. For example,
                    I am learning that not everything has to be perfect
                    and sometimes it's better to move on.</p>

                    expenses etc.
                    Actually that is my first project. I started learning Java and I fell in love with programming.
